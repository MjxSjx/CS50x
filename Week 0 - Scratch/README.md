The evil Dr. Kerr has stopped the rain from coming down on the land. Set out on a journey to find where his evil hasn't tarnished the land and save your peoples immediate future.

**Be warned the game is very campy.**

I made it in 4 days after all. However, I am proud of the rain falling and splashing effects.
